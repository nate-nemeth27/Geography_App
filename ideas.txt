OOP
- Need a class for a game
    - Functions and variables for a game can be different per subclass of a game, but they all need the same functions
    - Short list of what I'm thinking before making a UI:
        - Game Name (Guess Capitals, Guess Countries, etc.)
        - What you're given
        - What you're guessing
    - Probably won't need much more than that unless you get a bit more complicated
    - Some more complicated ideas I think I may want to implement:
        - Making a map UI to guess where a country is on a map by clicking
        - Making a map UI that highlights a country once it's guessed
        - Guessing a list of things (ex. all countries in the world, the top three cities in a given country)

- Need a class for a country
    - This is just to make it easier to build a framework where all countries have the same info
    - Then when a game is played, you can write the code for country.getCapital() without knowing what country to add abstraction
    - Some data needed for country
        - Name
        - Capital
        - Continent
        - Flag
    - Some later data for a country
        - Coordinates for a map UI
        - Biggest cities (may need to make a city class with info on it if you want specifics on cities)
        - Population
        - GDP
        - Biggest export
        - National religion if it has one
        - Style of government
        - Landmass
        - Landlocked, peninsula, island, archipelago, etc.
        - Neighboring countries
        - Neighboring bodies of water
        - River and lakes in it
        - Mountain ranges in it
